NASA launched LandSat 8 in 2013 to monitor earth by periodically taking pictures from space. These pictures are available for developers through
NASA's Open API initiative found here: https://open.nasa.gov/
This project asks for a set of images at coordinates between two dates and turns them into a gif using an library called gifshot. 
It's meant to be kind of like a time lapse of any large scale event/construction/natural disaster on earth. 

Things to note:
1. To run the program, open index.html in a browser or visit http://ec2-52-89-223-5.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/gif_project/
2. The program uses an API key which has maybe a 100-200 request limit per hour on a rolling basis. If the API limit is reached, wait a while
and try again.
3. If you get a dialog box that asks if you want to navigate away from the page, stay on the page!
